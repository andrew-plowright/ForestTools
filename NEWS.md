# ForestTools 0.1.1

Modified 'SegmentCrowns' function so that it can produce tree crowns in polygon format. The function will also calculate crown area, and filter out crowns that are not associated with a treetop point location.

Changed name of 'TreeTopSummary' function to 'SpatialStatistics'. This reflects its new functionality, which allows crown maps to be inputted, as well as treetop locations.
